Matt & Caycie - June 15, 2013
=============================

# Description
Simple, single-page website that I put together for my wedding this past year (6/15/2013).  Built with Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.0 and based on the Ditinggal Rabi Wedding Invitation Bootstrap Theme.

# Custom "Maps" Section
This site includes a custom map of the wedding and reception locations that utilizes jQuery, AJAX, and the Google Maps API. Note: I do not take credit for the majority of the site theme, just the content and the "Maps" section.
